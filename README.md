# TechSupportTicketSystem
 
This project is a prototype technical support ticket system created for a software development class.

This website application was created using PHP and MySQL, using XAMPP as a development platform. 

After installing XAMPP, the included techsupport.sql file can be used to re-create the database tables for testing.

This project is not created for commercial / live productions and is intended for educational use only.
